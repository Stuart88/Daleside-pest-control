                Moles are incredible little creatures and to some landscapes cause little issues or problems, in fact their
                excavation can be said to aid the land by draining and irrigating it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately moles also present a risk of causing listeria outbreaks in sheep. 
                When farmers cut fields for hay or silage, the mud from mole hills will mix into the cuttings
                and can cause bacteria such as listeria to multiply. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When fed to sheep in the winter this can cause listeria outbreaks and
                will kill many of the sheep. This is a cost no farmer can afford, so in these situations the moles in the area must be taken seriously.

                Moles can shift up to 540 times their own body weight of earth and tunnel up to 200 metres per day!
                They are extremely hard working individuals, typically working in patterns of 4 hour shifts, with a 4 hour
                sleep in between, meaning they typically spend 12 hours tunnelling every day.
            </p>*@
            <p>
                As well as this, moles' underground tunnels and molehills can create uneven
                ground and holes that livestock can be injured by.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moles can also be a real pain for gardening enthusiasts,
                digging up and making a mess of a pristine lawn in no time at all.

            <h3 class="pest-section-title">Methods</h3>
            <p>
                High powered spring-loaded traps are the best means of dealing with moles humanely.
            </p>
            <b>NOTE:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Traps must be checked daily by law. We will usually check them twice-daily - morning and night - to allow
                    quicker reset and hopefully to catch again sooner.
